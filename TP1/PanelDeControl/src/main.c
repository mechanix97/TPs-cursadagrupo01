 *  - model_setTimer and
 *  - model_unsetTimer
 *  are defined.
 *
 *  This state machine makes use of operations declared in the state machines
 *  interface or internal scopes. Thus the function prototypes:
 *  - modelIface_opLED
 *  are defined.
 *
 *  These functions will be called during a 'run to completion step' (runCycle)
 *  of the statechart.
 *  There are some constraints that have to be considered for the
 *  implementation of these functions:
 *  - never call the statechart API functions from within these functions.
 *  - make sure that the execution time is as short as possible.
